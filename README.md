# Karaoke-App

In our group of four people, we used our collaboration skills and project management strategies to work together to create this fun karaoke application!

We used Materialize and SCSS as our modern responsive CSS frameworks.

We also used jQuery with three of our APIs to retrieve our information.

The APIs we used were:
  1. MusixMatch
    a. This API retrieved the lyrics from our text input. Since we used a free trial for this API, we were only able to retrieve 30% of          the lyrics.
  2. Bing Custom Search
    a. We used this API twice: Youtube and Genius lyrics.
    b. We used Bing to access Youtube because this was our music source.
    c. We used Genius lyrics because MusixMatch only produced 30% of the song's lyrics. We also used Genius because it provides the lyrics        and the meaning behind the lyrics, which we decided our users would find interesting.
  3. Bands in Town API
    a. This API lets the users know how many fans are following our particular artist.
    b. It also lets the users know about the artist's upcoming concerts.
